# The QTUM Foundation Trusted IoT Alliance award

The Trusted IoT Alliance in collaboration with the Qtum Foundation are expanding the blockchain communities understanding of what use cases, reference architectures, and smart contracts built on top of Qtum protocol work best for IoT and edge computing uses.

### Goals

The goal of this program is to fund work that helps the Qtum community better understand how current and future features of the Qtum protocol can be applied to the Internet of Things. The Qtum protocol currently supports execution of both EVM and Bitcoin style transactions in a unified system. This allows for unique concepts like using both Bitcoin Payment Channels and Solidity smart contracts.


### Proposals:

We are looking for proposals from the general public and Trusted IoT Alliance members to build and describe use cases.

Proposals should go towards the development of reference architecture, smart contract code, and prototypes.

Desired things from Qtum:

- Bridging IoT and Mobile ecosystems using Qtumâ€™s protocol
- Data collection in the IoT space from sensors, tracking data for supply chain, etc.
- Bringing lightning networks and offchain transactions (both value transfer, and smart contract interactions)  to IoT
- Design and prototypes for QTUM smart contract applications

Detailed system testing of features of the Qtum protocol in an IoT context would also be considered for funding.

### Use of Funds:
Proposals should describe the proposed use of funds in significant detail. 

Funds can be use for purchasing equipment, compensating labor, purchasing research or other services.

Awards should target an expenditure level of approximate $50k in their initial phases.

### Open Source and IPR:
The Alliance is especially interested in proposals that produce concrete outcomes like smart contracts, protocol specifications and open source code. Source code produced as part of a grant execution will be open sourced under the Trusted IoT Alliance IPR policy under the Apache 2.0 license.

### Selection of Proposals
Proposals from the general public should anticipate forming partnerships with a Trusted IoT Alliance member for eligibility and partnerships that involve 1 or more members

Proposals will be selected by the vote of the Trusted IoT Alliance Selection committee during our January member meeting.

Submissions must be before *Jan 19th*. Final proposals should be submitted as Issues on this Git repository.

We will select among chosen proposals at our January 26th Member meeting.

Proposers will have the oppounity to present either remotely or in person at the members meeting if feasible.

Information proposals can submitted for feedback at: https://trustediot.consider.it/ for feedback and to solicit additional partners in any proposals.
